# :open_book: Description
Word Counter is a very simple application to count words in a text. It does not only count the number of words, but also provide a list with the most repeated words in the text. It is useful to identify possible redundancies within the text. 

This application is useful to support grant/fundins applications, abstract submissions, or an other publication where sections are limited to a maximum number of words.

This is a work in progress, so there is a lot functionalities that can be added :thinking:
